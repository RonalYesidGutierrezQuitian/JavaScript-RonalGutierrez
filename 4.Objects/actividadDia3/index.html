        <h3>Requerimietos</h3>
        <p class="punto" id="punto1">1. Write a JavaScript program to create a class called "Person" with properties for name, age and country. Include a method to display the person's details. Create two instances of the 'Person' class and display their details.</p>
        <p class="punto" id="punto2">2. Write a JavaScript program to create a class called 'Rectangle' with properties for width and height. Include two methods to calculate rectangle area and perimeter. Create an instance of the 'Rectangle' class and calculate its area and perimeter.</p>
        <p class="punto" id="punto3">3. Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Vehicle' with properties for make, model, and year. Include a method to display vehicle details. Create a subclass called 'Car' that inherits from the 'Vehicle' class and includes an additional property for the number of doors. Override the display method to include the number of doors.</p>
        <p class="punto" id="punto4">4. Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called "BankAccount" with properties for account number and balance. Include methods to deposit and withdraw money from the account. Create some instances of the "BankAccount" class, deposit some money, and withdraw a portion of it.</p>
        <p class="punto" id="punto5">5. Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Shape' with a method to calculate the area. Create two subclasses, 'Circle' and 'Triangle', that inherit from the 'Shape' class and override the area calculation method. Create an instance of the 'Circle' class and calculate its area. Similarly, do the same for the 'Triangle' class.</p>
        <p class="punto" id="punto6">6. Write a small JavaScript program that demonstrates constructor chaining usin a hierarchy of three classes as follows: A is the parent of B which is the parent of C. Modify your definition of A so that it has exactly one constructor that takes an argument, and show how B and/or C must be changed to work with it.</p>    
        <p class="punto" id="punto7">7.  A Computer Science department keeps track of its CS students using some custom software. Each student is represented by a Student object that features a pass() method that returns true if and only if the student has all six ticks to pass the year. The department suddenly starts teaching NS students, who only need four ticks to pass. Using inheritance and polymorphism, show how the software can continue to keep all Student objects in one list in code without having to change any classes other than Student.</p>
